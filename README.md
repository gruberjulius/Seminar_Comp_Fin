#Seminar in Computational Finance

Code for the Seminar in Computational Finance.

The demo_ABIDES-Markets.ipynb file contains a simulation script, where one can set different parameters for the following parameters and look at the behaviour when simulated on an exchange:

* Number of Market Makers
* Number of Value Agents
* Number of Momentum Agents
* Number of Noise Agents

Interestingly different behavious can be seen when looking at the plots.
